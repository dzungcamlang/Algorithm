	This is a implementation of queue in linked list.
Unfortunatelly,today, 2014.09.13, I find it work well but
correctly. The length of the queue is a constant. That's
not right! But this code will also help you to know the
knowledge of ADT-queue.

	I release the other implementation of ADT-queue
which work correctly!

You could got that correct version here:
