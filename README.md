Algorithm
=========

Hello Everyone 
# : )

    Here is my practice code for ADT(abstract date type) and algorithm.

    They are programmed with C. Now I am going to rewrite it with Python
    which I think is a very convenient and cool programming language.

    It will be my pleasure if the code will help you to solve your problem.
    I am glad to receive your e-mail, if you find something wrong with my implementation. 
    Just e-mail me @__@
